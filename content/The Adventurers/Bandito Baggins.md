Seeking Redemption: Bandito wants to prove that he’s truly changed and seeks to make up for the misdeeds of his past.

# Backstory
Born in the depths in a city, Bandito was raised in the hidden nooks and alleyways where only the most daring or desperate would dare to tread. Bandito had always been nimble, with quick hands and quicker feet—perfect qualities for the life of an outlaw. His raccoon-like appearance and natural ability to sneak in and out of places unseen made him a rising star among the local bandit clans.

For years, Bandito thrived in the underworld, plundering caravans, raiding small towns, and outwitting local authorities. As his reputation grew, so did his ego. He took pride in his clever escapes and the spoils of his raids—particularly anything shiny, which he hoarded obsessively. But Bandito's successes caught the attention of a band of heroes—adventurers who wouldn’t stand for his thieving ways. Time after time, they foiled his plans, thwarted his ambushes, and brought him to an all time low in humiliating defeats.

At first, Bandito shrugged off these losses, chalking them up to bad luck. But as the defeats piled up, so did his frustration. No matter how carefully he planned or how quickly he fled, the heroes always found him. With each defeat, he found himself less content with the loot and more disillusioned with the life of a bandit. The "spoils" of war—cracked weapons, tarnished coins, and cheap trinkets—began to lose their appeal. And the thrill of the heist? It was replaced by the bitter taste of failure and the endless cycle of running, hiding, and losing.

One fateful night, after a particularly crushing defeat at the hands of the heroes, Bandito found himself alone, attending his wounds in a dark, damp alley. As he stared into the night sky, the glint of distant stars reflecting in his eyes, he realized that he was tired. Tired of running, tired of losing, tired of being a villain.

For the first time in his life, Bandito considered a different path. A lawful path. A path where he could use his cunning and skills for something greater than just personal gain. He resolved to turn over a new leaf, to stop taking from others and instead help protect those in need.

The road to redemption wasn’t easy. The reputation of "Bandito the Outlaw" was hard to shake, and many were skeptical of his intentions. But Bandito was determined. He honed his skills as a swashbuckler, mastering the art of the duel and refining his sense of honor. Where he once took, now he gave—offering his services to those in need of protection, guiding caravans through dangerous lands, and even working alongside the very adventurers who had once bested him.

Despite his change of heart, Bandito never lost his mischievous streak. He still had a fondness for shiny things and a quick wit that often got him into trouble, but now his actions were driven by a desire to do good. He might not always follow the rules to the letter, but his heart was in the right place. Bandito was no longer just some bandit—he was a hero in the making, trying to balance his roguish nature with a newfound sense of justice.
