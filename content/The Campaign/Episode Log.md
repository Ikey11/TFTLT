## Conclusion

# Hare Rising

## Conclusion
The tribes of the [[Dallowmarch]] reported a monstrous being inhabiting their ancestral burial sight within the [[Bone Fields]] and requested that it be removed. This creature was revealed to be the [[Bone Monger]], who simply seeks to trade for significant bones, promising magical items in return.
Along the way to the adventurers cross paths with knights of a rising [[King Pendragoon]], seeking an artifact known as **The Holy Grail** to affirm his status. The knights fail the trials set before them, believing their authority stands within the wilds.
As the players pass the trials set before them by the [[Bone Monger]], they reach the burial sight, housing the monstrous body of the unearthly merchant. The creature notices the heavily armed party, and springs to attack, protecting its amassed collection.
After defeating the [[Bone Monger]], the adventurers recover its *bone collection* and artifact **The Holy Grail**.

### The Hag
The players pass by a Hag's house, who enchants Bandito's longbow in return for a lock of hair. Don Rochi becomes suspicious of the Hag, attacking her for her deceitfulness. The Hag flees, gravely wounded.
