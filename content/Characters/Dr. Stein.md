# Description
"Wizard, golemancer, and biosmith **Doctor Francis Norman Stein**."

A reclusive biomancer wizard, his obsession leaning towards being creepy, his experiments horrific. Stein's frail human frame is bulky and misshaped, with arcanomechanical contraptions littering his body.

[[L'Ars√®ne]] mentions that Stein used to be a respectable character and was famous for his designs, until he left [[The Loot Tavern]] in pursuit of his own endeavors.
