## His Rule
An immense red dragon who had once ruled the region of [[Haemspire Peak]]. He was a lazy, greedy red dragon content to let its kobold underlings fetch tithes from the surrounding lands.

The dragon has gone missing, and rumors stir from the region surrounding *a  new disastrous dragon ruler*.
