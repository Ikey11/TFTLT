# Description

Vivacious and charming, Humperdink is a neutral good dhampir (offspring of a vampire and human) in his early thirties. Humperdink ascribes to a polyamorous lifestyle, finding attraction is anyone who shares his lust for life. He is also a member of the **Order of the Pink Ribbon**, a collection of lycanthropes vampires, and other flesh-eaters who have sworn off eating humanoid or humanoid-derived products.

Humperdink has pursued research into the school of biomancy in the hopes of creating a serum that can Totally Replace Unseemly Blood, or **Tru-Blood**, as a nutritious foodstuff for vampires.

He admires people with extravagant fashion sense and a flair for the dramatic, his alter ego, *HumperDinker*, hosts the tavern's weekly burlesque performance.
