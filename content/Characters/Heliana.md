# Description
Heliana is the quest giver of [[The Loot Tavern]].

Heliana is a hard-headed LN half-orc hunter in her late thirties She rises early in the morning for calisthenics workouts, often running around the tavern with great, thumping footsteps, much to Humperdink and Lutecia’s chagrin She has an extraordinary metabolism, which is responsible for her chiseled physique and propensity to become hangry Luckily, both Peeper, and Heliana’s partner, a female golynn named **Amber**, have a steady supply of monster jerky to deal with this.
