This module puts great emphasis on the local, focusing on how the environment hosts new types of dangers and types of people. The stinking marshlands may be home to skeletons sunken in quick stand, or a suspect witch seeking hair in return for enchantments.

# The Low
Perhaps one of the most mysterious regions, the low is a vast underground network home to strange races.

# The East Mountains
Above the low is a vast mountain range, taking up an entire section of the continent, supporting high flying beasts and bunkering dwarfs.

# The West Forests
The west is filled with lush temperate greenery, with denser jungle towards the western coast. Home to remote elf villages, rich with beasts obscured by nature.

# The Arctic Reach
Far south of the west island are hilly planes covered by thick snowfall.

# The Blackstone Ridge
A region known for its intense volcanism, the blackstone ridge is a small continent within the frigid regions of the north.
The tall spires are home to dragonites who thrive in the volcanic heat.
