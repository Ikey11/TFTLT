**Location:** The heart of the Springwood Forests

**Springarden** is a sprawling, forested *garden*, home to the [[Blossom Union]], a group of druid-monks. It is a sacred, peaceful place which, through its entanglement with the **Plane of Fey**, *exists in a perpetual spring-time bloom*. The air is sweet with the scent of new blossoms; a soft breeze rustles the leaves and creates pleasing, delicate ripples on the water's surface. In its remote, forested domain, Springarden is typically a destination for pilgrims of nature deities, those who seek sanctuary, and travelers seeking a hot spring in which to dip their toes.
