The **Tanglepines** are twisted woodlands, once a rich source of ruler-straight lumber, the conifers of this forest have become gnarled and twisted over the years.

## Theories for the Mutated Forest
- Natural Selection:
	- As lumber jacks seek only the straightest timbers to fell, it is the more twisted trees that would survive to propagate, producing more twisted offspring.
